Hi! I am Aida Aminian, a Master's student in Computer Science at York University, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~kamalis/">Prof. Shahin Kamali</a>, <a href="https://wiki.eecs.yorku.ca/lab/tg/start">Theory of Computing Group</a>. Before joining York University in September 2023, I received my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Shahid Beheshti University. My current research interests are in the field of theoretical computer science. I am passionate about research and love to solve theoretical problems that contain real-life applications.
